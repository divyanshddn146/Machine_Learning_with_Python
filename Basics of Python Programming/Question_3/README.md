## Question 3:
#### **Write a program to to demonstrate printing a string with single quotes,double quotes, and triple quotes**

==Some Reference about how Strings in python are written.==
### Strings in Python

In Python, strings can be represented using single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """). Each of these has slightly different behavior, and the choice between them depends on your specific requirements. Here's an overview of the differences:

* Strings can be defined using either single or double quotes interchangeably.
* Triple quotes are used for multiline strings or strings that span across multiple lines.

**Note:** Irrespective of of the way string is specified, all strings are mutable in python. This means that once we created a string it cannot be changed.
